Big company is employing a lot of employees. Company would like to analyze it's organizational structure and identify potential improvements. Board wants to make sure that every manager earns at least 20% more than the average salary of his direct subordinates, but no more than 50% more than that average. Company wants to avoid too long reporting lines, therefore we would like to identify all employees which have more than 4 managers between them and the CEO.

You are given a csv file which contains information about all employees. File structure looks like this,

Id,firstName,lastName,salary,managerId
123,Joe,Doe,60000,
124,Martin,Chekov,45000,123

Each line represents an employee(CEO included). CEO has no manager specified. Number of rows can be upto 1000

Write a simple program which will read the file and report:
1. Which manager earn less than they should and by how much
2. Which manager earn more than they should, and by how much
3. Which employees have a reporting line which is too long, and by how much

Key points:
1. Use Java SE and Junit
2. Maven
3. App should read data from a file and print output in console.
4. Code will be assessed on correctness, simplicity, readability and cleanliness
5. If you have any doubts, make a sensible assumption and document it.
